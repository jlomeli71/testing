# Development Plan: Python Application for Network Device Discovery & Inventory

## Project Objectives
- **Automate discovery** of network devices using routing tables and ISIS database.
- **Aggregate and inventory** discovered devices with relevant metadata.
- **Provide exportable reports** (CSV/JSON) of the device inventory.

## Milestones & Timelines

### 1. Requirements & Design (Week 1)
- Define data sources (routing table, ISIS DB formats).
- Specify device attributes to inventory.
- Design application architecture and data models.

### 2. Data Collection Modules (Weeks 2-3)
- Implement parsers for routing tables.
- Implement parsers for ISIS database.
- Unit test data extraction.

### 3. Device Discovery Logic (Week 4)
- Correlate data from both sources to identify unique devices.
- Handle duplicates and conflicting data.

### 4. Inventory Aggregation & Storage (Week 5)
- Design inventory schema.
- Implement aggregation logic.
- Store inventory in memory or lightweight database (e.g., SQLite).

### 5. Reporting & Export (Week 6)
- Implement export to CSV and JSON.
- Create summary statistics (device types, counts, etc.).

### 6. CLI/Basic UI (Week 7)
- Develop command-line interface for user interaction.
- Add options for input files, output formats, and filters.

### 7. Testing & Documentation (Week 8)
- Write integration and system tests.
- Prepare user and developer documentation.

### 8. Deployment & Review (Week 9)
- Package application for distribution.
- Conduct code review and gather feedback.
